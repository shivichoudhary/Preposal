# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

-make a contact book
-make a mad libs generator
-possibly combine it with my education and liberation final -- try to figure out how to do this

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is there a rubric or some sort of requirements for this project? I know you mentioned an A is if it amuses you or makes any sort of impact to the world however coding purposes and complexity purposes I was just wondering.
